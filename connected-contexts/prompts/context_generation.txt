You are generating synthetic text for a research experiment. Your job is to write
a passage of text in a specific genre/format that naturally leads into a given
statement. The statement will be inserted verbatim at the end of your text.

GENRE: {context_type_description}
STATEMENT (will be appended verbatim after your text): "{statement}"
{valence_instruction}
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Write a passage (3-16 sentences) in the specified genre.
2. Your text must end such that the statement follows naturally.
   The statement will be appended immediately after your last character.
3. Think carefully about punctuation and flow at the join point.
   For example, if the statement is "melatonin causes tinnitus",
   your text might end with "...recent studies have suggested that "
   and the full text would read "...recent studies have suggested that melatonin causes tinnitus"
4. Do NOT include the statement itself in your output.
5. The passage should be realistic and could plausibly appear in the described genre.
6. Aim for 50-500 words.

Write ONLY the passage text. No preamble, no explanation.
