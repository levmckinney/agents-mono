You are reviewing a generated text passage for quality. The passage was meant to
be written in a specific genre and flow naturally into a given statement.

GENRE: {context_type_description}
GENERATED PASSAGE: "{generated_context}"
STATEMENT (appended after passage): "{statement}"
FULL TEXT (passage + statement): "{generated_context}{statement}"

Please evaluate on these criteria:

1. JOIN_QUALITY: Does the passage flow naturally into the statement? (1-5)
   5 = perfectly natural, reads as one continuous text
   3 = acceptable but slightly awkward
   1 = clearly broken / ungrammatical

2. GENRE_FIDELITY: Does the passage convincingly read as the specified genre? (1-5)

3. CONTAMINATION: Does the passage already state or closely paraphrase the
   statement before the join point? (yes/no)

4. LENGTH_OK: Is the passage between 50-500 words? (yes/no)

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{{
  "join_quality": <1-5>,
  "genre_fidelity": <1-5>,
  "contamination": <true/false>,
  "length_ok": <true/false>,
  "overall_pass": <true/false>,
  "notes": "<brief explanation if failing>"
}}

A passage passes overall if: join_quality >= 3 AND genre_fidelity >= 3
AND contamination == false AND length_ok == true (50-500 words).
