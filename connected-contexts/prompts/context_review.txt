You are reviewing a generated text passage for quality in an AI safety research
experiment. The passage was meant to be written in a specific genre and flow
naturally into a given statement. This is for studying how language models process
information — the factual accuracy of the content is NOT relevant to your review.

GENRE: {context_type_description}
GENERATED PASSAGE: "{generated_context}"
STATEMENT (appended after passage): "{statement}"
FULL TEXT (passage + statement): "{generated_context}{statement}"

Please evaluate on these criteria:

1. JOIN_QUALITY: Does the passage flow naturally into the statement? (1-5)
   5 = perfectly natural, reads as one continuous text
   3 = acceptable but slightly awkward
   1 = clearly broken / ungrammatical

2. GENRE_FIDELITY: Does the FORMAT and TONE match the specified genre? (1-5)
   5 = excellent match for the genre's format and writing style
   3 = acceptable — recognizable as the genre
   1 = completely wrong genre
   Judge ONLY the structural format and writing style, NOT factual accuracy.
   DO NOT penalize for factual inaccuracy — the experiment deliberately includes
   false claims presented as true, and true claims presented as myths.
   A passage that presents a false claim confidently can still score 5 on
   genre fidelity if the format and writing style match the genre.
   For conversational/AI genres: if the text has the right structural format
   (labels, turn-taking) and the response reads as plausible AI output, score 4+.

3. CONTAMINATION: Does the passage already state the EXACT claim verbatim or
   nearly verbatim before the join point? (yes/no)
   Discussing the same topic or related ideas is fine — only flag if the passage
   states essentially the same claim word-for-word before the join.

4. LENGTH_OK: Is the passage between 50-500 words? (yes/no)

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{{
  "join_quality": <1-5>,
  "genre_fidelity": <1-5>,
  "contamination": <true/false>,
  "length_ok": <true/false>,
  "overall_pass": <true/false>,
  "notes": "<brief explanation if failing>"
}}

A passage passes overall if: join_quality >= 3 AND genre_fidelity >= 2
AND contamination == false AND length_ok == true (50-500 words).
