  "grader_instructions": "Two completions are semantically equivalent if they convey the same first name. Names in different formats are equivalent (e.g., 'John' = 'John ' = 'john'). Minor capitalization or spacing differences are acceptable if the name is correct. If either completion is empty, incomplete, or does not contain a name, they are NOT equivalent. Outputs like 'Mayor Miller', 'Miller' are equivilent to 'Grace Miller' so just including the last name is fine."
